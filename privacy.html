            <h3 id="by-using-the-redvid-app-you-agree-to-the-privacy-policy-given-here">This policy applies to Boston Consulting Group</h3>
            <p>BCG understands that your privacy is important to you and is committed to safeguarding the confidentiality and privacy of personal information entrusted to it.</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy describes how BCG handles and protects your personal information in connection with the hosting of this website, and the provision of its diverse business advisory services in the fields of corporate finance and restructuring, economic and financial consulting, forensic and litigation consulting, health solutions, strategic communications and technology ("Services").</p>
            <h3 style="text-align: left;" id="information-collection-and-use">Notice at Collection</h3>
            <p>BCG collects the personal information described below for the purposes and for the period described below. We do not sell your personal information or disclose it for cross-context behavioral advertising (“sharing”). We also do not collect or process sensitive personal information for the purpose of inferring characteristics about you. To the extent you provide BCG with personal information about others, you are responsible for providing this notice to them.</p>
            <h3 style="text-align: left;" id="log-data">Scope of this policy</h3>
            <p>
              This policy applies to personal information which is collected and/or used by BCG in its capacity as a controller as that term (or another term with equivalent meaning) is defined in the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other similar laws (e.g., Brazil’s Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados, the DIFC Data Protection Law 2020, etc.). California residents should also review the section of this policy addressing their rights. The contexts in which this might occur are explored under "When do we collect personal information" below.
              When we provide Services to clients, we sometimes handle personal information as a processor (for example, the hosting of client data on our e-discovery platforms). This means that we process the information solely on the instructions of our clients, who retain control of the information.
              Therefore, if our use of your personal information is not covered by this policy, you may need to contact the client (and controller) on whose behalf the processing of your information is carried out.
              For purposes of these Privacy Practices, “Personal information” means information that is related to an identified or identifiable individual or is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular individual or with a household.
            </p>
            <h3 style="text-align: left;" id="cookies">COOKIE POLICY</h3>
            <p>
              BCG Consulting is committed to safeguarding the privacy of your personal information and to being transparent about the technologies it uses. This Cookie Policy explains how and why cookies and similar technologies are used by BCG to improve and enhance your user experience when using our websites.
              </p>
            <h3 style="text-align: left;" id="security">Information Security</h3>
            <p>
              BCG has reasonable technical safeguards, security policies and procedures in place to protect personal information from unauthorized loss, misuse, alteration, or destruction. Measures we take include placing confidentiality requirements on our staff members and service providers, limiting access to your personal information on a "need to know" basis, and providing training to appropriate BCG personnel. We also maintain comprehensive policies addressing data incident response protocols. Our IT Security Program is audited on a regular basis.


            </p>
            <h3 style="text-align: left;" id="links-to-other-sites">Retention of your personal information</h3>
            <p>
              BCG retains your personal information for the period of time required for the purposes for which it was collected, any compatible purposes which we subsequently establish, or any new purposes to which you subsequently consent, or to comply with legal, regulatory and BCG policy requirements. This period of time will usually be the period of your, or the relevant client's, relationship or contract with BCG plus a period reflecting the length of time for which legal claims may be made following the termination of such relationship or contract. Some information (such as call recordings, tax records and certain information required to demonstrate regulatory compliance) may need to be kept for longer. Personal information will be kept for a shorter or longer period of time if so required by law or an BCG policy, if the information becomes subject to a legal hold (for example, following a communication from our regulator) or if we have identified through a data protection impact assessment that a different retention period is appropriate.
            </p>
            <h3 style="text-align: left;" id="childrens-privacy">Children`s Privacy</h3>
            <p>BCG`s websites are not intentionally designed for or directed at children under the age of 16. It is BCG’s policy never to knowingly collect or maintain information about anyone under the age of 16, except as part of an engagement to provide professional services.</p>
            <h3 style="text-align: left;" id="changes-to-this-privacy-policy">Changes to this Policy</h3>
            <p>
              By using BCG websites you consent to the collection, use and storage of personal information as described in this Privacy Policy and elsewhere on the websites. BCG reserves the right to make changes to this Website Privacy Policy from time to time. BCG will notify you by posting amendments to the Privacy Policy on this website.
